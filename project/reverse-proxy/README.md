# Reverse proxy

This directory contains the configuration files for the reverse proxy with Nginx and the dockerfile for generating the Nginx image.

Through this proxy, it is possible to access two UIs and one API, namely:

- Kafka-UI: UI for visualizing Kafka data.

- graph-view: UI for visualizing the complex network.

- webapi: API for accessing pre-processed market data.
