# RealStockInsight: Financial Co-Movements Network Project

üåç *[Portugu√™s](README.md) ‚àô [English](README_en.md)*

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find some [examples](./examples) and a [project](./project) that have been developed for exploration and learning of some technologies associated with Cloud Computing. Feel free to explore the code and contribute!

## Project Description

The goal is to create an application focused on analyzing the financial market through complex networks, revealing connections, and providing insights into interactions among market actions. [This project](./project) involves building a distributed application to capture, process, and visualize financial data, representing them as an interactive network of co-movements. Using a container-based architecture, the application is divided into several parts that manage the collection, processing, and visualization of financial data.

## Technologies Used

- **Apache Kafka:** To manage real-time data streams.
- **Docker:** To ensure the portability and replicability of the development and execution environment.
- **Python:** Used in Kafka producer and consumer services.
- **Networkx:** Python library for the study of complex networks.
- **Golang:** For API implementation.
- **React:** For UI implementation.
- **PostgreSQL:** To store various data.
- **Stock Market APIs:** For real-time market data collection.
- **Apache Cassandra:** Not used in the current version, but there are some tests done with this type of database to store complex networks. [See examples](./examples/Cassandra_DB)
